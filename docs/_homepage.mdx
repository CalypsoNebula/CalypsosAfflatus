# Text version introduction  

(for friends who have difficulty viewing images or who need webpage translation)    

(I originally wanted to use the spoiler collapse tag, but unfortunately, the spoiler format on the CurseForge page doesn’t allow any text formatting — not even line breaks — so I had to put the text version directly below instead. Sorry for the messy look of the layout.)  

## Introduction
This mod adds multiple rechargeable night vision goggles that can automatically activate based on light level.

The basic model can be crafted early in your adventure,  
while advanced versions offer special abilities to help you explore the darkness with ease.
